What Causes Canon Printers to Go Offline?

- **Spooler Service Errors (Windows):** A stuck print spooler service can halt printing.
- **Paper Jams or Hardware Warnings:** Physical issues like paper jams can also trigger offline status.
- **Default Printer Not Set:** Your system may try sending print jobs to another device if the Canon printer isn't set as the default.
